                <h3>Psychological News Today</h3>
                <p>Psychology Today is an American media organization with a focus on psychology and human behavior. It began as a bimonthly magazine, which first appeared in 1967. The Psychology Today website features therapist and health professional directories[2] and hundreds of blogs written by a wide variety of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, medical doctors, marriage and family therapists, anthropologists, sociologists, and science journalists.

                    Psychology Today is among the oldest media outlets with a focus on behavioral science. Its mission is to cover all aspects of human behavior so as to help people better manage their own health and wellness, adjust their mindset, and manage a range of mental health and relationship concerns.
                    
                    Psychology Today content and its therapist directory are found in 20 countries worldwide.[3] Psychology Today's therapist directory is the most widely used[4] and allows users to sort therapists by location, insurance, types of therapy, price, and other characteristics. It also has a Spanish-language website.[5]
                    
                    The print magazine's reported circulation is 275,000 as of 2023</p>

                <h3>Does Social Media Cause Imposter Syndrome?</h3>
                <p>Many hard-working professionals enjoy the feeling of accomplishment after a job well done and bask in the warm glow of well-deserved accolades. That is, until they check their LinkedIn page to see how their success matches up to that of their peers.

                    For many competitive high achievers, however, once they log on, objectivity flies out the window and they feel inferior reading about how much more their peers and competitors seem to have accomplished by comparison. Whether true or not, believing one’s own accomplishments pale in comparison to others throws a wet blanket on professional pride. So, why do we look?
                    
                    Assuming for the sake of argument that everyone else’s showcased accolades are true, there may be limited value in keeping pace with peer productivity. Research explains.</p>

                <h3>No Single Gene Is Responsible for Schizophrenia</h3>
                <p>Many TV shows, novels, biographies, and movies in recent years have been released that speculate why it is that some families develop schizophrenia more often than others. Six Schizophrenic Brothers is one of the more recent films, while biographies like A Beautiful Mind still ground the canon as a classic in the public’s references to schizophrenia.

                    This cultural knowledge is mostly expressed by what we do currently know, which has been gathered by scientific studies and surveys. However, what we know about schizophrenia is small and repetitive and includes some of these items:
                    
                    Schizophrenia occurs globally–in all cultures and throughout time.
                    Schizophrenia is ranked twentieth out of all medical disorders in mortality rates.
                    Lifespan can be reduced by 12-15 years.
                    Family history of psychosis appears pronounced, especially in families where mental health diagnoses appear in clusters of relatives.
                    Risk for developing schizophrenia is more associated with the fact that families have mental illness at all, rather than having been specifically diagnosed with schizophrenia.
                    In twins, heritability is 60-65 percent.
                    There has been a race to search for biological indications that this disorder is a physical one, not just a social and cultural one. But it doesn’t seem that heritability is that straightforward. Scientists have been working on studies for years now that isolate potential genetic variants that could be responsible for the development of schizophrenia.</p>

                <h3>Psychiatric Diagnoses Don’t Explain ‘Why’—Only ‘How’</h3>
                <p>Faulty suggestion of causation is not restricted to depression. According to other researchers, the very word "disorder" at the end of psychiatric diagnoses erroneously implies cause: “Saying someone has ‘attention deficit’ leads us to search for the cause [‘why do they behave like this?’], whereas ‘attention deficit disorder’ implies the cause has been found.” In other words, “Oh, so that’s why they behave like this!”
                    The researchers have a very simple solution. “Drop the term disorder from all classifications. Just drop it.”3
                    Leaving out that one word does not detract from the actual challenges faced by people in which the problem behaviours are observed, they say, but provides the incentive to see someone in the round and explore all options for helping them make the best of their abilities. (After all, many of the "symptoms" listed for ADHD can be positive attributes as well.)
                    How different it might have been for Marion if, when she received her diagnosis of major depressive disorder 30 years ago, someone had thought it was relevant why she was depressed—her marriage had broken down and she hadn’t seen it coming. Instead of getting the chance to learn coping skills, and maybe some relationship skills, she had an "illness" bestowed on her, on which ever after she could blame anything that didn’t make her happy.</p>
